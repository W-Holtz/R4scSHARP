Description: A compilation of 5 single cell classification tools. 'R4scSHARP' is capable 
    of running 5 different tools ('SCINA', 'scSorter', 'scPred', 'SingleR', and 'scType') 
    on a single set of transcriptomic data, and creating a cell type profile generated 
    from single-cell RNA sequencing. These results can be used by other programs to obtain
    more accurate cell classifications.
