Description: scSHARP is a robust software package used to classify single cells by cell 
    type based on their transcriptomic profile generated from single-cell RNA sequencing. 
    Intended for use by technically savvy research biologists, but perhaps available to a less 
    technically proficient audience, our tool will be built with ease of use in mind. scSHARP 
    would also serve as a research tool in its own right, helping users interpret their 
    classification results with helpful models and figures. This document contains the 
    nontechnical information and purpose of scSHARP.
